# Frontend Development Rules - ForgettingCurve

## Core Technologies
- **Angular 17**: Comprehensive framework for building interactive SPA applications with component-based architecture (including Standalone Components)
- **TypeScript 5**: Static typing, code quality improvement, and IDE support
- **Angular Material**: Comprehensive UI component library compliant with Material Design

## Project Architecture
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Component-based architecture
- **Standalone Components**: Utilization of standalone components introduced in Angular 17
- **Supabase Auth Integration**: Frontend handles login/registration through Supabase Auth (`supabase-js`)
- **API Communication**: Connection with ASP.NET Core backend through RESTful API

## Coding Conventions

### File Naming
- All files use kebab-case
- Use appropriate suffixes following Angular conventions

### TypeScript
- Full utilization of static typing offered by TypeScript 5
- Definition of interfaces for communication with ASP.NET Core backend
- Avoiding the `any` type

## Angular Components
- Application built on component-based architecture
- Utilization of Standalone Components introduced in Angular 17
- Ensuring interactivity through proper use of Angular mechanisms

### UI/UX
- Using Angular Material for responsive layout
- Utilizing ready-made Material components: buttons, forms, tables, dialogs
- Ensuring consistent look of the entire interface compliant with Material Design

### Backend Integration
- Implementation of communication with Supabase Auth
- JWT handling for API security
- Typed communication with ASP.NET Core backend

## Security
- Secure integration with Supabase Auth
- Proper handling of JWT tokens
- Protection against common frontend threats (XSS, CSRF)
